## Course Description:
In this course, you will learn how to design technologies that bring people joy, rather than frustration.  
Designs fail for many reasons, but most often, the underlying problem is a lack of understanding users (humans)
including their abilities, needs and goals. 

This course provides an introduction to and overview of the field 
of human-computer interaction (HCI). HCI is an interdisciplinary field that integrates theories and methodologies 
from computer science, psychology, design, and many other areas.  
  
The interdisciplinary field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) draws upon computer science, design, engineering
and psychology to build useful, engaging, and usable interfaces. This course covers a rich set of HCI methods and
tools, both from a theoretical and practical point of view, in use by today’s HCI professionals for designing and improving technologies.  


## Course Goals:
In general, this couse will teach you how to understand user needs, turn those needs into design requirements, build a prototype from 
those requirements, and evaluate and iterate on your design. 
- Learn the basic physiological, perceptual, and cognitive components of human learning and memory.  
- Identify needs from users, identify any challenges they have with respect to using a technology or interface, and uncover opportunities for design.
- Implement strategies for brainstorming and ideation.
- Build out design requirements from ideas.
- Utilize techniques and tools for prototyping.
- Understand good design principles and methods
- Understand how to evaluate and improve upon a design.
- Understand Accessibility and Universal Design


## Sources
We will follow portions of a variety of sources in this class and so there is no required textbook. A nonexhaustive list of sources can be found [here](/resources/).

## Course Content:
The schedule for the course can be found on the course [homepage](/index.md/).

## Course Communication:
We will be utilizing a combination of Slack, Email, and Blackboard for this course. The assignments will be posted to Blackboard 
and will be turned in using Blackboard. Should you have questions on an assignment, please either use Slack or Email. 


## Grading:
The following table shows the categories of graded items and how much weight they each carry towards your final course grade:

| **Graded Items** | **Percentage**|
|------------------|---------------|
| Short Exercises  | 10%|
| Reading Reflections | 10%|
| Assignments      | 20%|
| Project          | 40%|
| Exam #1          | 10%|
| Exam #2          | 10%|

For all graded items, late submissions or make-ups will not be accepted unless an exception is granted by the instructor prior to the due date.  

We will not meet during finals week. The last project is the primary deliverable due at the end of the semester.   

### Short Exercises (10%):
There will be 10 short exercises throughout the semester that will require you to work in small groups to discuss and work together and turn in a solution. 
Each of these short exercises are worth 1% of your final grade. Whether the short exercise should be completed individually or as a group will be 
communicated for each short exercise.

## Reading Reflections (10%): 
Reading reflections will ask you to first, complete the reading that was assigned. Then you will be asked to not just summarize, but reflect on the reading
and write a brief reflection that will be posted on Slack. Then you will be asked to read and interact with your peer's reflections. We will start class 
by having a discussion around the reading and your reflections. 

### Assignments (20%): 
There will be three assignments totaling 30% of your final grade (10% each). These assignments will give you a chance to practice the skills you've learned in class. 

### Project (40%):
You will participate in a semester long project in which you will design, implement, and evaluate a user interface. User interface design is an iterative process, 
so you will build your UI not just once, but multiple times, as successively higher-fidelity and more complete prototypes. The assignments will help guide you 
along the process of building out your project and make sure you are making progress on the project throughout the semester. This project is a group project and should be copmleted in groups of 3 or 4 students.

### Exams (20%):
There are two exams, each of which are worth 10% of your final grade. They are very tentatively scheduled for:
- Exam #1: October 13th 
- Exam #2: November 22nd

## Attendance
In-person attendance is strongly encouraged--Short Exercises will be conducted in-class and will need to be turned in before the end of class.
I will record lectures and 
 
Final grades will be awarded based on the following scale: 

| **Percentage** | **Grade**|
|------------------|---------------|
| 92.0-100  | A|
| 90.0-92.0 | A-|
| 88.0-90.0 | B+|
| 82.0-88.0 | B |
| 80.0-82.0 | B-|
| 78.0-80.0 | C+|
| 72.0-78.0 | C |
| 70.0-72.0 | C-|
| 68.0-70.0 | D+|
| 60.0-68.0 | D |
| 0.0-60.0  | F |

Percentages are **not rounded** when using this scheme, because this would be tantamount to moving all of the grade boundaries down by 0.5%. 


## Collaboration Policy
As a default policy, you may work with each other on projects and assignments; however, every student must implement program code, 
perform experiments, and write up the accompanying results separately (unless otherwise specified). Sharing completed solutions 
(verbally, physically, electronically, etc.) is not acceptable. If you work with someone, you must say so somewhere in your assignment, 
and you must affirm that you in fact worked together and that no completed solutions were shared. For instance, in the comments of a 
program or at the top of a written page, you must write something like “I worked on parts X and Y of this assignment with person Z. 
No completed solutions were shared.”   
  
You are not to collaborate with anyone except for the instructor and other students enrolled in Human Computer Interaction this semester.   


## Academic Integrity
Students are encouraged to seek out resources for help in understanding concepts when completing coursework. However, there is a big difference between seeking 
outside resources for help in understanding and searching for solutions. All solutions prepared with the aid of any source, however minor, must specifically cite 
those sources and explain the relationship of the submitted solution to the source. All citations must include author names, titles, publication information, and 
links to electronic sources when they exist. For programming code, all such citations and explanations should be included with comments. When in doubt, be 
open and transparent about the use of sources. This will shift the issue away from a question of academic integrity penalties to a question of how many points
to award for your contributions. A violation of the course’s collaboration policy will also be considered an academic integrity violation.  
 
The minimum penalty for a first violation of academic integrity will be a forfeiture of all points on the entire assignment or exam in question. 
A second violation will result in a grade of ‘F’ for the course. All violations will be reported to the College of Arts and Sciences Dean’s office as explained 
in the [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.drake.edu/artsci/studentresources/policiesandregulations/).

## Student Disability Services:
If you have a disability and require academic or physical accommodations in this course, please contact me and Student Disability Services 
(Michelle Laughlin, Director of Student Disability Services, at 2711835 or michelle.laughlin@drake.edu) in advance of the date the accommodations are needed. 
All requests for assistance must be received (at least) four full business days prior to the requested need.

## Covid-19 Course and University Policies:

### Masks and Social Distancing
When we do meet in person, we will all wear masks to minimize the likelihood of the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Doing so is not only a requirement in our class, but is also a campus-wide policy. I will ask those who choose not to wear a mask to leave the classroom and, 
following guidance from the Provost’s office, I will alert the dean of students’ office.  

### Instructions for Students who Test Positive
If you test positive for Covid-19 or have been exposed and need to isolate yourself, please send an email to dos@drake.edu from your Drake email account and 
include your full name and student ID along with information about your situation. College and schools’ deans’ offices will then contact your professors, 
who will work with you to provide fully virtual learning opportunities during your quarantine and/or recovery. If possible, however, please also alert me 
directly that you will begin attending virtually, and I will work with you to help you make the transition to that modality. You do not need to tell me why 
you need to move to a virtual experience. 

### Instructions for Students about Self-Monitoring and Experiencing Symptoms:
Please carefully monitor your own health and wellbeing throughout the semester, including frequently taking your own temperature. 
If you experience Covid-19 symptoms or a fever, even if you do not test positive, please do not come to an in-person class meeting. 
Fill out your information using the following [Drake self-monitoring form](https://drake.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eSbezU698csxbcp).
