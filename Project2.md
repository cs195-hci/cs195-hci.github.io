# Project Deliverable 2: Prototyping [ 50 points ] 

**Due**: Monday, 10/4 by 11:59 pm.

## Project Description:
In the next step of your semester project, your team will work together to: 
1. Choose a storyboard to prototype
2. Design a lo-fi prototype (can be paper or digital)
3. Evaluate your lo-fi prototype
4. Reflect on the findings from your thinkalouds
5. Fill out the peer and self evaluation.

## Part 1: Choose a storyboard to prototype [ 5 points ]

Look back at the storyboards that you created from your brainstorming session in P1. 
Deliberate as a group and decide which idea you would like to move forward with for the rest of the
semester. Feel free to modify the idea slightly, for example if you can combine idea to make a 
slightly broader impact, please do so. Your idea should be substantial enough that you can come 
up with 3 simple tasks and 2 complex tasks for your user to complete.

### Part 1 Deliverables:
- [ 2 points ]Explanation of which idea you decided to continue with and why 
- [ 3 points ] What are the design requirements for this idea? What functionality is necessary?


## Part 2: Design a lo-fi prototype for the idea you chose [ 25 points ]
Work as a group to design/develop a lo-fi (paper or digital) prototype for your group’s idea.
Note that this doesn’t necessarily have to be a paper prototype, you are welcome to try using
online wireframing tools, however, I encourage you to keep the fidelity low, we still want our
participants to see the prototype as changeable. 

### Part 2 Deliverables:
- [ 15 points ]Submit a link to a video walkthrough of your lo-fi prototype (make sure share settings are set correctly so that I can clikc on the link and watch your group's video).

## Part 3: Evaluate your lo-fi prototype [ 20 points ]
Design 3 simple, isolated tasks, and 2 complex tasks for your user to accomplish. 
Each group member is responsible for conducting one thinkaloud using your lo-fidelity prototype. 
Ideally you will have thinkaloud data from both groups of stakeholders that you interviewed in P0. 
Most groups have 4 individuals in them, so this means 4 thinkalouds for a group of 4—you should aim
to have 2 of the thinkalouds be from a user from stakeholder group 1 and 2 of the thinkalouds be 
from a user from stakeholder group 2. 

### Part 3 Deliverables:
- [ 5 points ]What are the tasks that your group has decided on? Make sure that there are 3 isolated tasks and 2 complex tasks.
- [ 2 points ]Who are you stakeholders? Which group member will be responsible for running a thinkaloud with which stakeholder group?
- [ 10 points ]Include detailed notes from each thinkaloud. Each group member should come up with positive and negative UARs from their thinkaloud.
- [ 3 points ]Compile the UARs into a list--come up with a way to organize these so that they make sense and are easy to digest. I'd suggest the ID reflect who ran the thinkaloud, what stakeholder group the participant was in, as well as what task the UAR is specifically referring to. 

## Part 4: Reflection [ 5 points ]
Based on your collection of UARs, what aspects of your interface are most in need of revision in the next iteration?
How do you plan to implement your proposed solutions? (please talk about at least one usability fix, if you couldn't find one,  you probably weren't paying close enough attention to your participants). 

## Part 5: Self and Peer Evaluation [ 5 points ] 
Please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/J9N4GrV37bKz84tQ6) to provide feedback on how effectively your group is working together. I will compile the results and provide a score out of 6 for each person that will represent how effective of a team member they have been.
