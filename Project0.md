# Project Deliverable 0

**Due**: Monday, 9/27 by 11:59 pm.

## Project Description:
A big part of CS195:HCI is the semester project. This project provides an opportunity to integrate and practice the concepts from all the parts of the course.
You will work in groups to address an existing problem, brainstorm solutions, prototype solutions, and evaluate your designs. 
This is an opportunity to make a real contribution and develop your portfolio.

## Part 1: Form Teams
Use the slack channel [#project-team-formation](https://hci-f21.slack.com/archives/C02ETFL8M3Q) to form teams of up to 4 people. 
- Diversity is your friend here, a diverse spread of skills will make this project better.
- As soon as you have it, send me an email with:
  - Your teamname:
  - Team members: 

From the email, I'll create groups on blackboard. You will only need to submit one copy of P0 for your group to blackboard.

## Submit to Blackboard
A 1-page (or less) report that identifies:

- your team's Name (whatever you want, school appropriate)
- team members names
- description of the topic, including user community and tasks
- problem scenario(s): what are the various problems your project is intended to solve
