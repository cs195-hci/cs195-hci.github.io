# Assigment 0: Hello World
This is the first assignment of the semester. 

**Due**: September 1st, 2021 by 11:59pm

It consists of the following parts: 

## Part 1: Introductory Questionnaire
Fill out the [Introductory Questionnaire](https://forms.gle/LG131Pri4ziiKr3x5).

## Part 2: Introduction to Slack
1. [Join the Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/hci-f21/shared_invite/zt-us259xj5-Go00xrmOYvHNIFWGytSqxQ)
2. **Say Hello**: Navigate to the [#hello-world channel](https://hci-f21.slack.com/archives/C02C7KWEQSE). In this channel please post answers to the following questions: 
  - Where are you from?
  - Why are you taking this course?
  - What do you do when you're not taking this course?
  - What's one interesting fact about you?
  - A (school appropriate) meme to describe how you're feeling about the upcoming semester. 
3. **Interact and Socialize**
  - Reply to someon else's introductory post with something that you found interesting, 
a shared common interest, or a follow-up question. Just generally engage with at least one of our classmates.
  - React to someon else's post using an emoji.
4. **Send me a DM**
  - Send me a quick Direct Message with whatever you'd like--a quick hello, something you're excited/nervous about this semester, 
a question about the course, a picture of your pet...


## How to turn it in:
For ease of grading, I'm asking you to document the 4 steps in Part 2 using screenshots. Please take a screenshot of your original post to #hello-world, 
your interaction with a classmate, and your DM. Put these screenshots in a document and submit that document to the Blackboard assignment link before the end of the day on 9/1 (11:59pm).
