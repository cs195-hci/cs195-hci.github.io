# Assigment 2: Prototyping Practice
**Due:** Monday 10/11, by 11:59 pm

This assignment is worth 30 points and will give you an opportunity to practice both low and hi fidelity prototyping.

In this assignment, you will **design an app for a smartphone that provides automation control for a smart home**. 

Assume that the house you're building this app for has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room. You can also assume that there are sensors in place for you to get the necessary data from the house.

## Part 1: Paper Prototype
Build a paper prototype that has the following features: 
- **lighting control** [ 5 points ] 
  - check the status of lights (on/off) for any room
  - turn on/off light in any room.
  - Schedule when lights turn on/off according to a plan (day, night, weekends, etc)
- **climate control** [5 points ]
  - check the temperature of any room or whole house
  - set the temperature of any room or whole house
  - Schedule temperature changes according to a plan (day, night, weekends, etc)
- An additional **feature of your choice** [ 5 points ] 
  - Describe what you added 
  - If you're stumped here, some ideas may be adding control of a smart lock, being able to view security camera footage, an intercom system, alarm system, etc.

Note that your paper prototype doesn't have to be perfect, please don't spend hours and hours on it. 
To submit your paper prototype, take pictures of your prototype and put them in a document. Be sure to describe what your additional feature is. 

## Part 2: Test your paper prototype [5 points]

Find someone who is willing to test your paper prototype for you. Ask them to complete the following tasks: 
- Turn off the lights in the kitchen
- Set the temperature for the entire house to 70 degrees.
- Set up an automation so that all of the lights in the house turn off after 10pm. 
- Add one more task here that tests the additional feature you added. 

Take notes on which tasks they were able to complete as well as any issues they ran into. It may be helpful (but isn't required) to record the user while they use your prototype. Submit your notes and an explanation of any usability issues you found from testing.

## Part 3: Build out a hi-fi protoype in Figma. [ 10 points ]

Use Figma to build a hi-fi prototype of your smart home automation system. Your prototype should be built from your original paper prototype, and should include any changes that you think are necessary after watching a user interact with your prototype. Be sure to explain any changes that you made. Include a link to your Figma prototype in the document that you submit to Blackboard.
