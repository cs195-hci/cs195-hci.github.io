# Assigment 2: Hi Fidelity Prototype using Figma
**Due:** Monday 10/11, by 11:59 pm

This assignment will give you an opportunity to practice using Figma to design hi fidelity prototypes. It

In this assignment, you will design an app for a smartphone that provides automation control for a smart home. 
Assumptions: 
1. Use the following basic floor plan: 
  - 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, living room
2. The required sensors and connectivity are in place (i.e. you donâ€™t have to design how information is gathered from the house).

This assigment is worth 15 points, and should include the following: 

- **lighting control** [ 5 points ] 
  - check the status of lights (on/off) for any room
  - turn on/off light in any room.
  - Schedule when lights turn on/off according to a plan (day, night, weekends, etc)
- **climate control** [5 points ]
  - check the temperature of any room or whole house
  - set the temperature of any room or whole house
  - Schedule temperature changes according to a plan (day, night, weekends, etc)
- An additional **feature of your choice** [ 5 points ]

To submit your assignment, share your Figma prototype with me and submit the link to Blackboard. In your blackboard submission, write a quick description of what your additional functionality is.
