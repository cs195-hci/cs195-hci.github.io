# Project Deliverable 3: Hi-Fi Prototype and Expert Review [ 55 points ] 

**Due**: Monday, 11/15 by 11:59 pm.

## Project Description:
In the next step of your semester project, your team will work together to: 
1. Turn your paper prototype (from P2) into a hi-fi prototype [ 20 points ]
2. Expert Review [ 20 points ]
3. Revise Hi-Fi Prototype [ 10 points ]
4. Self/Peer Evaluation  [ 5 points ]

## Part 1: Build a Hi-Fi Prototype [ 20 points ]
Convert your lo-fi prototype from Project Deliverable #2 into a hi-fi prototype. Your hi-fi prototype should cover all functionality present in your 
lo-fi prototype—i.e. you should be able to complete all of the tasks assigned in the thinkalouds in P2 using your hi-fi prototype. 
Please leave comments to indicate functionality.  **If any issues or suggestions for improvement were pointed out during P2’s think-alouds,
be sure to implement these in your hi-fi prototype.**

### Part 1 Deliverables:
- [ 5 points ] Explain what design changes your group decided to make based on the findings from P2's thinkalouds.
- [ 15 points ] Publish your hi-fi prototype and include a link to your porotype in your submission. Make sure that you share the prototype with me so I have access to grade.


## Part 2: Expert Review Evaluations [20 points]
Each member of the group will be responsible for evaluating the hi-fi prototype using an expert review technique. The two expert review techniques that we discussed in class are:
-	Heuristic Evaluation
-	Cognitive Walkthrough
Please make sure that your group completes at least one heuristic review and one cognitive evaluation. 

### Heuristic Evaluation 
For your **Heuristic Evaluations**:

**Step 1**: Inspect each element against Nielsen’s 10 heuristics. Identify as many negative aspects as you can.
For each identified violation of the heuristics, record ID, name, and heuristic, and combine into a table format 
(column #1: ID, column #2: Name, column #3: Heuristic). 

**Step 2**: Summarize your findings as Usability Aspect Reports (UARs). Each “negative” UAR should include ID, Name, Evidence, Explanation, 
Severity (rating and justification with respect to frequency, impact and persistence – you must discuss all three to get full points), and Solution. 
Also, capture a couple positive aspects that you think are the “best.” Each “positive” UAR should include ID, Name, Evidence, and Explanation. 
Include a screenshot with each UAR for easy reference.

### Cognitive Walkthrough:
For your **Cognitive Walkthroughs**:

**Step 1**: For each task that was used in P2’s thinkalouds, first break each individual task down into processes (following the process of task decomposition). For each process, answer the 4 questions used by a cognitive walkthrough:
1.	Is the effect of the current action the same as the user’s goal?
2.	Is the action visible?
3.	Will the user recognize the action as correct?
4.	Will the user understand the feedback?

**Step 2**: If you answer ‘no’ to any of these questions, please create a UAR
Summarize your findings as Usability Aspect Reports (UARs). Each “negative” UAR should include ID, Name, Evidence, Explanation, Severity 
(rating and justification with respect to frequency, impact and persistence – you must discuss all three to get full points), and Solution. 
Include a screenshot with each UAR for easy reference.

### Part 2 Deliverables:
- [ 15 points ] You should have the same number of expert reviews as you do group members (e.g. if there are 3 members of your group, you should have 3 expert reviews). 
- [ 5 points ] Compile your results and provide a summary of the usability issues that have been found. 

## Part 3: Revise your Hi-Fi Prototype [ 10 points ]
Based on the feedback from the expert reviews that were conducted in Part 2, please make changes to your hi-fi prototype. 
This will serve as the ‘final’ product for the course’s project. 

Answer the following questions:
a.	What changes did you decide to make?
b.	Explain why these changes were made and how they aim to improve the design of your solution.
c.	Include a link to your updated hi-fi prototype. I would suggest duplicating your project so that you still have access to the first iteration 
of the hi-fi prototype to demonstrate the changes that you’ve made.

## Part 5: Self and Peer Evaluation [ 5 points ] 
Please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/J9N4GrV37bKz84tQ6) to provide feedback on how effectively your group is working together. I will compile the results and provide a score out of 6 for each person that will represent how effective of a team member they have been.
