# Project Deliverable 4: Final Project Deliverable 

**Due**: Monday 12/6 before class 

## Project Deliverable Description:
This is the final deliverable for the semester project in CS195: HCI. There are three parts to this deliverable:
1.	Group presentation on either 12/6 or 12/8
2.	A video overview of your project (meant to be something to put in your portfolio)
3.	Self and Peer Evaluations

## Part 1: Presentation
Your presentation should include an overview of your group’s project. The major findings from each project deliverable should be clearly communicated. 

So far throughout the semester you have worked through the following stages of the project.
-	Need finding (interviews)
-	Ideation and prioritization
-	Storyboard creation
-	Storyboard evaluation
-	Lo-fi Prototype Creation
-	Lo-fi Prototype Evaluation (multiple thinkalouds)
-	Hi-fi Prototype Creation
-	Hi-fi Prototype Evaluation (Expert Review)

From all of this creation/evaluation/analysis, you have a lot of data around your problem. 
The goal of this presentation is to combine all of this information in a clear and meaningful way, 
demonstrating what you’ve learned throughout the semester.

Your presentation…
-	Should be no longer than 10 minutes
-	Should cover relevant steps/findings from P0, P1, P2 and P3, being sure to touch on all of the steps mentioned above.
-	Should be informative, interesting, well organized, and clearly presented.
-	It is your prerogative to present this information how you see fit.

Deliverable:
-	All members of the group should be present for the presentation (but not everyone needs to participate in the presentation). 
-	Please submit your slides/presentation materials via blackboard

## Part 2: Video
In my experience, one of the best ways to start building a portfolio of projects that you have worked on to show your skills and abilities to potential 
employers is to build quick, easily digestible video descriptions of the projects that you’ve worked on. This is what you’ll be doing for this section of P4. 

The video you create should include a high-level description of the project, very similar to your live-presentation, but slightly more condensed. Your video should:
-	Be no longer than 5 minutes
-	Clearly and concisely explain the goal of the project, and demonstrate the relevant steps that led you to your final product.

Deliverable:
-	Please provide a link to the video via blackboard (in the text submission or in a document), the link can be to YouTube, or just a Google Drive link.

## Part 3: Self and Peer Evaluation [ 5 points ] 
Please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/J9N4GrV37bKz84tQ6) to provide feedback on how effectively your group is working together. I will compile the results and provide a score out of 6 for each person that will represent how effective of a team member they have been.
