# Project Deliverable 1: Needfinding and Ideation

**Due**: Monday, 10/4 by 11:59 pm.

## Project Description:
This is the second step for your semester-long project where you will be going through the steps to design a software solution. As the size of groups varies,
please use **N** as the number of members in your group. 

In this second step, your team will work together to: 
1. Conduct **N** need-finding interviews and analyze the data to establish user needs
2. Build out two personas
3. Brainstorm ideas to address the user needs from step 1. 
4. Create storyboards for **N** of your best ideas from step 3.  

## Part 1: Interviews [18 points]

a. [ 2 points ] Who are the stakeholders for this project? Identify at least two stakeholder groups who will act as your main users (for example, students and professors).

b. [ 5 points ] Build out a discussion guide for the interviews. Be sure to ask good questions--use the [Need Finding Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WHHTmOD-NebAH7PcEX51CW1ew1KdagpoFMAw661ZNQw/edit?usp=sharing) 
to make sure that your questions are not leading or yes/no questions. Each interview should last 10-15 minutes, make sure your discussion guide is robust enough to cover this.

c. [ 5 points ] Using the discussion guide you worked together to create in (b), conduct your interviews. Each member of your group is responsible for completing one interview. 
Make sure that each stakeholder group is represented in your interviews--ideally evenly represented (if I have two stakeholder groups and 4 people in my project group, 2 interviewees should be from group a and two from group b). 

d. [ 3 points ] Provide a link to the document that your group used to analyze your interview responses. I would highly recommend using a Google Sheet with the columns corresponding to each interviewee
and the rows each corresponding to a question.

e. [ 3 points ] What did you discover from these interviews? List at least 3, but preferably 5-6 user needs. Provide evidence for these needs as quotes from your interviewees, or clips of audio/video. 

## Part 3: Personas [ 10 points ]
Using the interview results, create two personas [ 5 points each ], one for each stakeholder group. 

Each personas should be around one page in length, and should include: 
- Name and Picture
- Demographics
- Title/Responsibilities
- Goals/Frustrations
- Quote

Tip: Think of who most of your target users will be and attempt to create a persona that covers their major needs. 

## Part 4: Ideation [ 8 points ]
a. [2 points ] Start by individually coming up with as many ideas as possible to meet the needs that you've discovered.

b. [2 points ] Meet up with your group and share your ideas. Have a brainstorming session and use the brainstorming tips that we discussed in class. 
Try to build off of each other's ideas and combine ideas. Make a new list of the group's ideas from the brainstorm.

c. [2 points ] Rate these ideas in terms of achievability (low or high) and impact (low or high). 

d. [2 points ] Create a new short list of high achievability and high impact ideas.

Please include the results from each stage of the ideation process (a-d).

## Part 5: Storyboarding [ 8 points ]
From the list you created in part 4, pick **N** (the number of people in your group) features to storyboard 
(if your final list from part 4 is too short and doen't have enough ideas for N features, go back and do more brainstorming!).

Each feature should have it's own storyboard. You may draw the storyboards by hand either on paper or digitally or use a storyboarding tool. 
Optional: you may use photos/images within your storyboard.
